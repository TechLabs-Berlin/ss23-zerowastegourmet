# ss23-zerowastegourmet

Abstract: 
In order to reduce food waste at home, we developed a web app called "ZeroWasteGourmet," which helps individual users to cook with recipes that minimize food waste, plan grocery shopping, and  plan meals with our weekly planner function.
Users can change their buying, cooking, and eating habits in a sustainable way. Our recipes encourage users to use all parts of an ingredient by cooking. For instance, onion peels, a broccoli stem, or ends of mushrooms can also be used instead of thrown away.
Our goal is to provide a sustainable cooking solution.
